- **.gitignore**: Specifies files/directories to ignore in git, such as the .env file.
- **admin_dashboard.py**: Allows hotel administrators to manage and update room bookings, dining bookings, spa services, and user feedback. Requires admin authentication via a password to access.

## Admin Dashboard Access:
### Overview:
The Admin Dashboard in HOSPI is designed for hotel administrators to monitor bookings, manage guest feedback, and view analytics. It enables administrators to:
- View Active Room, Spa, and Dining Bookings: Display real-time information on bookings, including the ability to update booking statuses.
- Monitor User Feedback: View guest feedback (thumbs up/down) and delete specific feedback.
- View Analytics: Provides insights on total bookings and feedback counts.

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard:
- **Login**: The admin dashboard is password-protected. After entering the correct password, the admin will have access to the dashboard.
- **Password**: The admin password is securely loaded from the .env file.
  
### Navigation:
- From the main screen, once the admin enters the password, they can click the **Go to Admin Dashboard** button in the sidebar.
- This will redirect them to the **Admin Dashboard** page, where they can view the data and perform administrative tasks.

### Admin Dashboard Features:
- **Active Room Bookings**: View and update the status of room bookings (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled).
- **Active Spa Bookings**: View and update spa booking statuses.
- **Active Dining Bookings**: View and update dining booking statuses.
- **Feedback Management**: Admin can delete specific guest feedback.
- **Analytics**: Shows counts for room bookings, spa bookings, dining bookings, and feedback.

### Admin Dashboard Logging:
- **Real-time Booking Logs**: Every booking made by a guest (room, food, spa) is logged into the system and displayed on the Admin Dashboard. Admins can view details of these bookings in real-time and track analytics for room, spa, and dining services.
